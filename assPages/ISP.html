                <h2>What does an ISP do?</h2>

                <p>Internet Service Providers, also known as an ISPs, provide services such as:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Internet Access</li>
                    <li>Website Design</li>
                    <li>Website Hosting</li>
                    <li>Email addresses</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>How do they provide acces to the internet?</h2>
                
                <p>Data, such as web pages or downloads, is pinged between host and client ISPs. Hosts being the source of the data, and clients being those accessing it.</p>
                <p>When you enter a domain name into a web browser, it is translated into the IP address assigned to the site by its ISP.
                    This ISP address is sent via your router to your ISP. They forward the request onto the ISP of the site you're attempting to access.
                    The web page is then sent back to your ISP (assuming access is succesful) who forward the data to your home router and your device.

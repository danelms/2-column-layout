            <h2>What's 'new' in HTML5?</h2>

            <p>
                According to Microsoft, the changes in HTML5 are mostly aimed towards
                meeting several objectives. These objectives are:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Encouraging Semantic Markup</li>
                <li>Separating design from content</li>
                <li>Promoting accessibility and responsiveness</li>
                <li>Reducing the overlap between HTML, CSS and JaveScript.</li>
                <li>Supporting rich media experiences without the need for plugins (Flash, Java etc.)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Encouraging Semantic Markup</h3>

            <p>
                Semantic markup is a term that refers to the use of semantic tags in HTML.
                For example, in previous versions of HTML elements such as headers or navigation menus
                would all use the 'div' tag. In HTML5 they can use the 'header' and 'nav' tags respectively.
                This makes the content more readable to developers.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are also text-level elements that have been added, like 'address' and 'time'.
                Search engines use these to find and display information from your page.
                Other text-level elements have been refined, such as bold, italic etc.
            </p>

            <h3>Promoting Accessibility and Design Responsiveness</h3>
            
            <p>
                Semantic and responsive design practices are being promoted within HTML5 for greater
                accessibility across conventional devices (tablets, computers, phones etc.), but also

            <h2>What's 'New' in HTML5?</h2>

            <p>
                According to Adam Wood, the changes in HTML5 are mostly aimed towards
                meeting several objectives. These objectives are:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Encouraging Semantic Markup</li>
                <li>Separating design from content</li>
                <li>Promoting accessibility and responsiveness</li>
                <li>Reducing the overlap between HTML, CSS and JaveScript.</li>
                <li>Supporting rich media experiences without the need for plugins (Flash, Java etc.)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Encouraging Semantic Markup</h3>

            <p>
                Semantic markup is a term that refers to the use of semantic tags in HTML.
                For example, in previous versions of HTML elements such as headers or navigation menus
                would all use the 'div' tag. In HTML5 they can use the 'header' and 'nav' tags respectively.
                This makes the content more readable to developers.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are also text-level elements that have been added, like 'address' and 'time'.
                Search engines use these to find and display information from your page.
                Other text-level elements have been refined, such as bold, italic etc.
            </p>

            <h3>Promoting Accessibility and Design Responsiveness</h3>
            
            <p>
                Semantic and responsive design practices are being promoted within HTML5 for greater
                accessibility across conventional devices (tablets, computers, phones etc.), but also for greater
                accessibility for the visually impaired. Unnecessary markup within HTML (styles) hinders assistive technologies
                such as: Screen readers, specialised browsers, braille interpreters, etc.
            </p>

            <h3>Reducing the Overlap Between HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h3>

            <p>
                As HTML, CSS and JavaScript continue to evolve, changes are made to better suit each to their
                intended purpose. HTML should be aimed towards creating content, CSS towards styles and designs,
                and JavaScript towards interactivity. HTML5 being the newest iteration of HTML, is the most
                focused on structuring content. Anything else <i>should</i> be handled by other languages.
            </p>

            <h3>Supporting Rich Media Experiences Without the Need For Plugins</h3>

            <p>
                Previously, HTML was solely aimed towards text-based content, perhaps with a few images.
                An increase in consumer internet speeds has led to an increase in the amount of media-based
                web pages containing audio and video. To run media within a browser, it was previously necessary
                to use plugins, such as Flash or Java. These plugins reduce performance and create security
                weaknesses. 
            </p>

            <p>
                HTML5 includes semantic elements like 'video' and 'audio' to support the inclusion of media without plugins.
                The 'canvas' element provides a space to run JavaScript graphics and drawings withinin a page.
                Thanks to the new elements and improved integration between HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it is
                possible to include media or create full in-browser applications using the three languages
                and without any plugins. 
            </p>

            <h2>What's 'New' in CSS3?</h2>

            <p>
                CSS3 does not remove any previous features, it just builds upon them allowing certain
                things to be achieved easier. It also adds some new features. The main difference in CSS3 is
                the seperation of CSS into modules (meaning all class names are scoped locally).
